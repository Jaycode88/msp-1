# Design
A sharp free flowing design with engaging imagery and call to actions were felt nessacerry to catch the users attention. Information provided in small sections to not loose user attention. Bright bold colours to keep the user engaged.



## Colour Scheme
Most locticians use  black gold and green to relate to the Jamacan culture of dreadlocks. How ever as a business that caters for all races and hair types we wanted to keep the theme natural and earthy hence the choice of slate, brown and oranges. I used [adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to create my colour scheme.

- 3E2C22 was used for text
- 241F20 Was used for headings
- E8A579 & F3B341 Used as Background colours
- EB7719 Used for call to actions and some image borders

## Typography
I have chosen to use Roboto as my preffered font as it is easy to read on all screen sizes. I used Verdana as the websafe font this is due to it being designed for monitors, having distinctive letter forms that help avoid confusion. Sans Serif was used as the fallback font due to it being generic.
The Roboto font was exported from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

Icons used were from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/)



# wireframes
To follow best practice , Wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet and desktop sizes

# High Fidelity  Prototype
I used [Figma](www.figma.com) to create high fidelity prototypes for mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

# Features
 The website consists of 4 pages, The index page is split into 2 pages consisting of "what I can Do for you" and "About me". It also has a gallery and a frequently asked questions page. I also added an overlay modal which displays a contact form when a contact button/link is actioned.

 # General Features
 ## Header
  The Header is responsive to all screen sizes. On large screens it expands horzontally, while on smaller screens the nav bar is replaced with a burger icon. Clicking this icon would make nav bar dropdown menu appear. There is also a seperate drop down menu that is accessed when clicking the home link this displays the options for each section of the page. The Nav bar is from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and then customised by myself.

  ## Footer
 The footer features contact information as well as icons linking to social media pages.

  ## Modals and Forms
  The Contact Me Modal is a pop-up actioned when the user selects a contact me button or Contact in the nav bar. The Modal is from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and then customised by myself. The Form clearly displays which inputs are required or optional with placeholder text.

## Home Page 
The home page is where the services offered and credibility are advertised. This page offers information on the services available as well as on the person providing them. The home page also makes it very easy for the user to make contact should they wish too.

## Gallery

## Frequently Asked Questions
The FAQ Page is where the user can find the answers to the most common questions. The questions and answers are set in a [Bootstrap Accordion](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/) There is also a video iframe in this section which has great relatable content.

# Future Features

## Contact Modal
The modal needs to connect to a backend system to be functional and store the user data and requests.
I also think a seperate modal that opens when the user submits on the first modal thanking them would be a great addition.

## Gallery
More real live examples and case scenarios to be added to further proove authority in sector.

## FAQ
More questions to be covered, This can be looked at when customer queries are recieved and can be assesed to analyse the most needed for this section.

## Footer
Correct contact information to be added once set up by business owner.
Social media icons will link to direct page rather than the social media homepages, Once social media pages have been set up.
